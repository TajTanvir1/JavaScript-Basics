      BMI Calculator and Health Category

      Create a JavaScript program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and assigns a health category based on the
      BMI value. Use nested if-else statements to determine the health category.

      - Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2
      - BMI < 18.5, you are underweight. - BMI>= 18.5 and BMI <=24.9, you are normal. - BMI>=25 and BMI <= 29.9, you are
               overweight. - Otherwise, you are obese. </p>

                  A: 90-100
                  B: 80-89
                  C: 70-79

                  you have two numbers in two variables, called: num1, num2

                  now declare a variable called result.
                  if num1 is bigger than num2 then result will be double of num1. if not, then the value of the variable
                  result will be the sum of num1 and num2.

                  write a simple if-else.

                  also, write it using ternary operator.
