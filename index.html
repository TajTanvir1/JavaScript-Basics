      What is JavaScript?
   </h3>
   <p>
      JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan
      Eich.
   </p>
   <p>
      JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D
      and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
   </p>
   <p>
      JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of
      the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

      Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as
      dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam,
      or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
      Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as
      Twitter or Facebook.
      Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and
      applications.
      It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the
      core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning
      area,
